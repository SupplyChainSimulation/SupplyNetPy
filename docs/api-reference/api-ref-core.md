## SupplyNetPy Components.core

Components.core Module

This module provides the essential components for building a supply chain simulation. 
It includes classes that represent various entities and their interactions within a supply chain.

__Classes:__

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Node | Represents a generic node in the supply chain. |
| Supplier | Represents a supplier node. |
| Manufacturer | Represents a manufacturer node. |
| InventoryNode | Represents a node that maintains an inventory. It can be a warehouse, distributor or retailer node. |
| Demand | Represents the demand at a particular node. |
| Link | Represents a transportation link between two nodes in the supply chain. |
| Inventory | Represents an inventory maintained by any Node. |

__Usage:__

Users can create instances of these classes to model a supply chain. Each class includes methods for setting attributes and calculating performance metrics.

Following is a list classes and methods in __core__ module.

Estimating Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) System Description As Best Buy sells its current inventory of HP computers, the purchasing manager places a replenishment order for a new lot of Q computers. Including the cost of transportation, Best Buy incurs a fixed cost of $S per order. The purchasing manager must decide on the number of computers to order from HP in a lot. For this decision, we assume the following inputs: D Annual demand of the product S Fixed cost incurred per order C Cost per unit h Holding cost per year as a fraction of product cost Assume that HP does not offer any discounts, and each unit costs $C no matter how large an order is. The holding cost is thus given by H = hC. The model is developed using the following basic assumptions: Demand is steady at D units per unit time. No shortages are allowed, that is, all demand must be supplied from stock. Replenishment lead time is fixed (initially assumed to be zero). The purchasing manager makes the lot-sizing decision to minimize the total cost the store incurs. He or she must consider three costs when deciding on the lot size: Annual material cost Annual ordering cost Annual holding cost Because purchase price is independent of lot size, we have Annual material cost = \\(CD\\) The number of orders must suffice to meet the annual demand D. Given a lot size of Q, we thus have Number of orders per year = \\(\\frac{D}{Q}\\) Because an order cost of S is incurred for each order placed, we infer that Annual ordering cost = \\((\\frac{D}{Q}){S}\\) Given a lot size of Q, we have an average inventory of Q/2. The annual holding cost is thus the cost of holding Q/2 units in inventory for one year and is given as Annual holding cost = \\((\\frac{Q}{2})H = (\\frac{Q}{2})hC\\) The total annual cost, TC, is the sum of all three costs and is given as Total annual cost, \\(TC = CD + (\\frac{D}{Q})S + (\\frac{Q}{2})hC\\) Image source: [Textbook] Supply Chain Management: Strategy, Planning, and Operation, (Chopra and Meindl) Above figure shows the variation in different costs as the lot size is changed. Observe that the annual holding cost increases with an increase in lot size. In contrast, the annual ordering cost declines with an increase in lot size. The material cost is independent of lot size because we have assumed the price to be fixed. The total annual cost thus first declines and then increases with an increase in lot size. From the perspective of the manager at Best Buy, the optimal lot size is one that minimizes the total cost to Best Buy. It is obtained by taking the first derivative of the total cost with respect to Q and setting it equal to 0. The optimum lot size is referred to as the economic order quantity (EOQ). It is denoted by Q* and is given by the following equation: Optimal lot size, \\(Q* = \\sqrt{\\frac{2DS}{hC}}\\) Numerical Example Demand for the Deskpro computer at Best Buy is 1,000 units per month. Best Buy incurs a fixed order placement, transportation, and receiving cost of $4,000 each time an order is placed. Each computer costs Best Buy $500 and the retailer has a holding cost of 20 percent. Evaluate the number of computers that the store manager should order in each replenishment lot. Analysis: In this case, the store manager has the following inputs: Annual demand, \\(D = 1,000 * 12 = 12,000\\) units Order cost per lot, \\(S = 4,000\\) Unit cost per computer, \\(C = 500\\) Holding cost per year as a fraction of unit cost, \\(h = 0.2\\) Using the EOQ formula, the optimal lot size is Optimal order size = Q* = \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{2 * 12,000 * 4,000}{0.2 * 500}} = 980\\) To minimize the total cost at Best Buy, the store manager orders a lot size of 980 computers for each replenishment order. The cycle inventory is the average resulting inventory and is given by Cycle inventory = \\(\\frac{Q*}{2} = 490\\) For a lot size of Q* = 980, the store manager evaluates Number of orders per year = \\(\\frac{D} {Q*} = \\frac{12,000} {980} = 12.24\\) Annual ordering and holding cost = \\(\\frac{D} {Q*} S + (\\frac{Q*} {2}) hC = 97,980\\) Average flow time = \\(\\frac{Q*} {2D} = \\frac{490} {12,000} = 0.041\\) year \\(= 0.49\\) month Each computer thus spends 0.49 month, on average, at Best Buy before it is sold because it was purchased in a batch of 980.

Pharmacy Supply Chain This study is from a publication 'Improving Simulation Optimization Run Time When Solving For Periodic Review Inventory Policies in A Pharmacy' , read it here . This study uses the simulation-based optimization (SBO) method to find the optimum values of replenishment policy parameters (s, S) to minimize the overall cost of the pharmacy supply chain. In this example, we aim to understand the supply chain network system described by the authors and to use SupplyNetPy to implement it and replicate the results. This exercise allows us to evaluate the complexity of reconstructing a specific system with SupplyNetPy and to validate the library. System Description It is a single echelon supply chain: (A distributor: Hospital Pharmacy, and a supplier: Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Facility) A distributor facing stochastic demand is connected to an infinite supplier. The supplier can be disrupted with probability = 0.001 at given day t. The distributor replenishment policy: (s,S) The product is perishable with shelf life of 90 days. The authors model and simulate the system to find optimum values of policy parameters (s,S) that minimizes total expected cost per day Inventory Type: Perishable Inventory position (level at given time t) = inventory on hand + inventory en route Replenishment Policy: (s,S) When level falls below s, order is placed for (S - current inventory position) units Review period = 1 day (monitor inventory everyday) H = Inventory at hand H' = Inventory at hand that expires at the end of the day t P = Inventory position = H + inventory en route This flowchart illustrates the order and sequence of events that take place at the pharmacy. ( Image source ) Algorithm: Process flow of Perishable Inventory Begin day t 1. Order arrive at the Pharmacy 2. Update Inventory Levels (H) 3. Satisfy demand based on Inventory Levels 3.1. If (d>H): - demand Satisfied = H - Shortage = d-H - Waste = 0 3.2. Else: - demand Satisfied = d - Shortage = 0 - Waste = max{0,H'-d} 4. Discard Expired Drugs 5. Update Inventory Levels (H) 5.1. Is (s>P) and (Supplier not Disrupted): - Place order for (S-P) 5.2. Else: - Do not place order 6. End of the day t Optimization Objective: Minimize Expected Cost per day Costs of interest are shortage, waste, holding and ordering Assumptions All drugs that arrive in the same month come from the same production batch and have same end of the month expiration date. Hence drugs are only discarded at the end of the month. The inventory on-hand is know each day. Estimated days until inventory expires is known each day. Lead time is deterministic and +ve. The Order placed at the end of the day (t-1), and arrives at the begining of the day t. Demand is stochastic. Supply uncertainty is due to disruptions (these two are independent of each other) All demand that is not met is lost. First in first out protocol is followed when serving orders.

In this problem, a decision-maker must determine the optimal order quantity for a perishable product with uncertain demand, aiming to maximize expected profit by balancing the risks of overstocking and understocking. Problem Definition The newsvendor orders Q units every day. Each unit costs c, and the selling price is p. The newsvendor faces normally distributed demand with mean \u03bc and standard deviation \u03c3. If, on a certain day, the actual demand is k, then the net profit after selling k units is calculated as: Profit = Revenue \u2212 Order Cost = k \u00d7 p \u2212 Q \u00d7 c However, if there are any units left unsold at the end of the day, they are considered wastage since they cannot be sold the next day. The newsvendor can sell these unsold units back to the supplier at a lower price, called the salvage value s. If the actual demand that day is less than the order size Q, then the net profit is thus calulated as: Profit = Revenue + Salvage \u2212 Order Cost = k \u00d7 p + ( Q \u2212 k ) \u00d7 s \u2212 Q \u00d7 c When the actual demand k exceeds the newsvendor's order quantity Q , the profit is calculated as: Profit = Q \u00d7 p \u2212 Q \u00d7 c \u2003 \u2003 (In this case, all available units are sold, and the profit is based on the total revenue from selling Q units minus the total ordering cost.) So, the newsvendor problem is defined by following parameters. Ordering cost (c) : Cost per unit ordered. Selling price (p) : Price per unit sold. Salvage value (s) : Value per unsold unit at the end of the period. Mean demand (\u03bc) : Average demand during the period. Standard deviation of demand (\u03c3) : Demand variability. Number of samples (n) : Number of demand samples for simulation. Order quantity (Q) : Quantity ordered for the period. The objective is to find the order quantity Q * that maximizes expected profit. Analytical Solution The optimal order quantity is given by: Q * = \u03bc + \u03c3 \u00b7 \u03a6 \u22121 ( C u / (C u + C o ) ) where: C u = p - c: Underage cost (profit lost per unit of unmet demand) C o = c - s: Overage cost (cost per unsold unit) \u03a6 -1 : Inverse standard normal C u /(C u + C o ): Critical ratio (proportion of demand to satisfy) Example Parameters Given: c = 2 p = 5 s = 1 \u03bc = 100 \u03c3 = 15 n = 1000 Q = 100 (example order quantity) Plugging in the values: C u = 5 - 2 = 3 C o = 2 - 1 = 1 Critical ratio = 3/(3 + 1) = 0.75 Q = 100 + 15 \u00b7 \u03a6 -1 (0.75) Q \u2248 100 + 15 \u00b7 0.6745 = 110.12 So, the optimal order quantity is approximately 110 units . Modeling and Simulating the Newsvendor Problem It is a simple three-node supply chain with one supplier, a newsvendor (retailer), and normally distributed demand at the newsvendor. Simulation Setup: An infinite_supplier is used to ensure unlimited supply to the newsvendor. The focus of the simulation is on the newsvendor node newsvendor1 , which: Maintains perishable inventory with a shelf life of 1 day. (Shelf life is set to value 1.00001 to avoid expiration before daily consumption.) Uses a periodic replenishment policy, ordering every day. The link between the supplier and the newsvendor has a lead time of 0, meaning orders are delivered immediately each day. Demand is modeled as a normal distribution. The normal_quantity() function samples order sizes from this distribution. Setting consume_available flag to True for demand allows partial fulfillment. This is necessary because, in the simulation model, the demand appears as a single order of Q units, but in reality, these are individual customers purchasing newspapers. This setup ensures that the simulation accurately represents the intended demand and fulfillment process for the newsvendor problem. import simpy import random import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import SupplyNetPy.Components as scm cost = 2 sell_price = 5 salvage = 1 mean = 100 std_dev = 15 num_samples = 1000 def normal_quantity(): \"\"\"Generates a random order quantity based on a normal distribution.\"\"\" sample = random.gauss(mean, std_dev) while(sample<0): sample = random.gauss(mean, std_dev) return sample cost = 2 # newspaper buy price sell_price = 5 # newspaper sell price salvage = 1 # newspaper salvage price order_quantity = 100 # initial order quantity cost_arr = [] # to store cost for each order quantity profit_arr = [] # to store profit for each order quantity for order_quantity in range(10, 200, 10): env = simpy.Environment() # create an infinite supplier supplier1 = scm.Supplier(env=env, ID=\"S1\", name=\"Supplier1\", node_type=\"infinite_supplier\") #create the distributor newsvendor1 = scm.InventoryNode(env=env, ID=\"D1\", name=\"News Vendor\", node_type=\"distributor\", capacity=float('inf'), initial_level=order_quantity, inventory_holding_cost=0.1, inventory_type=\"perishable\", shelf_life=1.00001, replenishment_policy=scm.PeriodicReplenishment, policy_param={\"T\": 1, \"Q\": order_quantity}, product_sell_price=sell_price, product_buy_price=cost) link1 = scm.Link(env=env,ID=\"l1\", source=supplier1, sink=newsvendor1, cost=10, lead_time=lambda: 0) demand1 = scm.Demand(env=env,ID=\"d1\", name=\"demand_d1\", order_arrival_model=lambda: 1, consume_available=True, order_quantity_model=normal_quantity, demand_node=newsvendor1) scm.global_logger.disable_logging() env.run(until=num_samples) # Calculate the cost and profit # total demand fulfilled by newsvendor is available in variable demand_fulfilled # list element 0 is number of orders, element 1 is total quantity daily_sales = newsvendor1.stats.demand_fulfilled[1] wasted_inventory = newsvendor1.inventory.waste everyday_profit = (daily_sales*sell_price + wasted_inventory*salvage - order_quantity*num_samples*cost)/num_samples profit_arr.append([order_quantity,everyday_profit]) profit_arr = np.array(profit_arr) # convert to numpy array for easier manipulation Q = np.argmax(profit_arr[:,1]) # index of maximum profit plt.plot(profit_arr[:,0], profit_arr[:,1], marker='.', linestyle='-', color='b') plt.plot(profit_arr[Q,0], profit_arr[Q,1], marker='o', linestyle='-', color='r', label=f'Q={profit_arr[Q,0]}') plt.xlabel('Order Quantity') plt.ylabel('Profit') plt.title('Profit vs Order Quantity') plt.legend() plt.grid() plt.show() The following plot shows the relationship between profit and order quantity (Q).

Takeway This example demonstrated how to solve the newsvendor problem using simulation-based approaches using SupplyNetPy library. By simulating different order quantities and evaluating the resulting profits, we can visualize and confirm the optimal order quantity that maximizes expected profit. This approach can be extended to more complex inventory scenarios and demand distributions, providing valuable insights for inventory management decisions.","title":"News Vendor"},{"location":"example-newvendor/#news-vendor-problem","text":"This example illustrates how to model and simulate the classic newsvendor problem .

Creating Nodes In this scenario, we create a supplier with a limited inventory capacity. A raw material needs to be created and provided to the supplier when it is created with finite inventory. This raw material is defined by several parameters, including ID, name, extraction quantity, extraction time, and cost. The supplier is designed to hold only a single type of raw material in its inventory and is responsible for mining it to maintain inventory levels to fill capacity. import SupplyNetPy.Components as scm raw_mat1 = scm.RawMaterial(ID='rm1', name='raw_mat1', extraction_quantity=1000, extraction_time=1, mining_cost=0.5, cost=0.8) supplier1 = {'ID':'S1', 'name':'supplier1', 'node_type':'supplier', 'capacity':5000, 'initial_level':5000, 'inventory_holding_cost':0.01, 'raw_material':raw_mat1} Creating a factory requires a product. A product and a factory can be created and configured as follows. product1 = scm.Product(ID='p1', name='product1', manufacturing_cost=20, manufacturing_time=1, batch_size=1000, raw_materials=[(raw_mat1, 2)], sell_price=30) factory1 = {'ID':'F1', 'name':'factory1', 'node_type':'factory', 'capacity':2500, 'initial_level':2500, 'inventory_holding_cost':0.02, 'replenishment_policy':scm.SSReplenishment, 'policy_param': {'s':1000,'S':2500}, 'product':product1, 'product_sell_price':30} distributor1 = {'ID': 'D1', 'name': 'Distributor1', 'node_type': 'distributor', 'capacity': 1000, 'initial_level': 1000, 'inventory_holding_cost': 0.2, 'replenishment_policy': scm.SSReplenishment, 'policy_param': {'s':300,'S':1000}, 'product_buy_price':30,'product_sell_price': 35} The factory's behavior is to produce products based on a replenishment policy. In this example, inventory will be replenished when the level drops below a threshold (s). Therefore, the factory will begin manufacturing products once the inventory falls below this level and increase it back up to its maximum capacity (S). Defining Links Links represent the flow of products between nodes, with associated transportation costs and lead times. links1f1 = {'ID': 'L1', 'source': 'S1', 'sink': 'F1', 'cost': 100, 'lead_time': lambda: 2} linkf1d1 = {'ID': 'L2', 'source': 'F1', 'sink': 'D1', 'cost': 120, 'lead_time': lambda: 3} Modeling Demand Demand is generated at the distributor using deterministic arrival and quantity models. demand1 = {'ID': 'd1', 'name': 'Demand1', 'order_arrival_model': lambda: 0.4, 'order_quantity_model': lambda: 30, 'demand_node': 'D1'} Running the Simulation Create the supply chain network and simulate it. supplychainnet = scm.create_sc_net(nodes=[supplier1, factory1, distributor1], links=[links1f1, linkf1d1], demands=[demand1]) supplychainnet = scm.simulate_sc_net(supplychainnet, sim_time=20, logging=True) Review Results Here is the simulation log generated by the network.

Estimating Safety Stock Level Safety inventory can help a supply chain improve product availability in the presence of supply and demand variability. Image source: [Textbook] Supply Chain Management: Strategy, Planning, and Operation, (Chopra and Meindl) System Description Bloomingdale sells Gucci purses. Demand is 100 per week. Gucci takes 3 weeks to deliver purses to Bloomingdale in response to an order. Therfore Bloomingdale can place an order when exactly 300 purses are remaining in the inventory. Given deand fluctuations, demand over three weeks may be higher or lower than that of 300. If it is higher, Bloomingdale will lose sales. The store manager decides to put an order of 400 purses (therfore, safety level is 100). Goal: To determine the appropriate level of safety inventory. Replinishment policies: Continuous review: Inventory is continuously tracked, and an order for a lot size Q is placed when the inventory declines to the reorder point (ROP). As an example, consider the store manager at B&M who continuously tracks the inventory of phones. She orders 600 phones when the inventory drops below ROP 400. In this case, the size of the order does not change from one order to the next. The time between orders may fluctuate given variable demand. Periodic review: Inventory status is checked at regular periodic intervals, and an order is placed to raise the inventory level to a specified threshold. As an example, consider the purchase of film at B&M. The store manager does not track film inventory continuously. Every Thursday, employees check film inventory, and the manager orders enough so that the total of the available inventory and the size of the order equals 1,000 films. In this case, the time between orders is fixed. The size of each order, however, can fluctuate given variable demand. Numerical Example Evaluating Safety Inventory, Given an Inventory Policy Assume that weekly demand for phones at B&M Office Supplies is normally distributed, with a mean of 2,500 and a standard deviation of 500. The manufacturer takes two weeks to fill an order placed by the B&M manager. The store manager currently orders 10,000 phones when the inventory on hand drops to 6,000. Evaluate the safety inventory and the average inventory carried by B&M. Also evaluate the average time a phone spends at B&M. Analytical Solution: Under this replenishment policy, we have Average demand per week, \\(D = 2500\\) Standard deviation of weekly demand, \\(\\sigma_D = 500\\) Average lead tme for replenishment, \\(L = 2\\) Weeks Reorder point \\(ROP = 6000\\) Average lot size \\(Q = 10000\\) using eq 12.3 in the textbook, safety inv, \\(ss = ROP - D^*L = 6000-5000 = 1000\\) B&M thus carries a safety inventory of 1,000 phones. Cycle inventory = \\(\\frac{Q}{3} = \\frac{10000}{2} = 5000\\) Average inventory = cycle inventory + safety inventory \\(= 5000 + 1000 = 6000\\) Average flow time = average inventory/throughput \\(= \\frac{6000}{2500} = 2.4\\) weeks System: Cost per unit, transportation cost is not given. So we can assume anything. We want to find Safety inventory level (the average number of phones on hand when a replenishment order arrives).

It enables us to define supply chain nodes, products, inventory, demand, and the links that connect them. We can easily assemble and customize supply chain models using these constructs to suit particular requirements. Create Nodes Let us create a supplier node in the supply chain that has infinite inventory and can supply any required quantity of product units to a consumer node. The supplier node requires several parameters, including ID, name, and node type. To set it as an infinite supplier, we must specify the node type as infinite_supplier . supplier1 = {'ID': 'S1', 'name': 'Supplier1', 'node_type': 'infinite_supplier'} A distributor or warehouse node that purchases products from a supplier is created below by specifying configurable parameters, including ID, name, inventory capacity, replenishment policy, policy parameters, product buy price, and product sell price. distributor1 = {'ID': 'D1', 'name': 'Distributor1', 'node_type': 'distributor', 'capacity': 150, 'initial_level': 50, 'inventory_holding_cost': 0.2, 'replenishment_policy': scm.SSReplenishment, 'policy_param': {'s':100,'S':150}, 'product_buy_price': 100,'product_sell_price': 105} When creating a manufacturer, distributor, wholesaler, or retailer, we must specify the inventory replenishment policy and its parameters. The SupplyNetPy Components module includes an InventoryReplenishment class that can be customized to define specific replenishment policies. Currently, SupplyNetPy supports the following replenishment policies: Reorder-level (s,S) \u2014 continuously monitor inventory and replenish up to S when the level drops below s. Parameters: {s, S} (class SSReplenishment ) Reorder-level (s,S) with Safety Stock \u2014 reorder-level replenishment that factors in a safety stock buffer. Parameters: {s, S, safety_stock} ( SSReplenishment ) Replenish Quantity (RQ) \u2014 reorder a fixed quantity Q when placing an order. Parameters: {R, Q} ( RQReplenishment ) Replenish Quantity (RQ) with safety stock \u2014 reorder a fixed quantity Q when placing an order. Parameters: {R, Q, safety_stock} ( RQReplenishment ) Periodic (T,Q) \u2014 replenish inventory every T days with Q units. Parameters: {T, Q} ( PeriodicReplenishment ) Periodic (T,Q) with safety stock \u2014 replenish inventory every T days with Q units. If safety stock is specified, then when the safety stock level is violated, order Q units in addition to the quantity needed to maintain safety stock levels. Parameters: {T, Q, safety_stock} ( PeriodicReplenishment ) Create a Link A link is created as described below. It is configured using parameters such as transportation cost and lead time. The lead time parameter accepts a generative function that produces random lead times based on a specified distribution. Users can create this function according to their needs or define a constant lead time using a Python lambda function. link1 = {'ID': 'L1', 'source': 'S1', 'sink': 'D1', 'cost': 5, 'lead_time': lambda: 2} Specify Demand A demand is created by specifying an ID, name, demand node, order arrival time, and order quantity. The order arrival parameter accepts a generator function that produces random arrival times, while the order quantity parameter takes a generator function that produces random quantities. Users can define a function that models these arrivals and quantities or use Python's lambda function to create a deterministic demand, as shown below. A demand can be created at either a distributor node or a retailer. In this example, we have created a steady demand for 10 daily units at distributor D1. demand1 = {'ID': 'd1', 'name': 'Demand1', 'order_arrival_model': lambda: 1, 'order_quantity_model': lambda: 10, 'demand_node': 'D1'} Assemble and Simulate the Network To create and simulate the supply chain, use the create_sc_net function to instantiate the supply chain nodes and assemble them into a network. This function adds metadata to the supply chain, such as the number of nodes, and other relevant information, keeping everything organized. It returns a Python dictionary containing all supply chain components and metadata. The simulate_sc_net function then simulates the supply chain network over a specified period and provides a log of the simulation run. It also calculates performance measures such as net profit, throughput, and more. Let's use these functions to build and simulate our supply chain. # create a supply chain network supplychainnet = scm.create_sc_net(nodes=[supplier1, distributor1], links=[link1], demands=[demand1]) # simulate for 20 days supplychainnet = scm.simulate_sc_net(supplychainnet, sim_time=20, logging=True) Review Results After the simulation, inspect supplychainnet to view performance metrics for the supply chain nodes. By default, the simulation log is displayed in the console and saved to a local file named simulation_trace.log , which is located in the same directory as the Python script. Each node in the simulation has its own logger, and logging can be enabled or disabled by providing an additional parameter: logging=True or logging=False while creating the node. SupplyNetPy uses a global logger referred to as global_logger , which allows to show or hide all logs by calling scm.global_logger.enable_logging() or scm.global_logger.disable_logging() . Below is an example of a simulation log generated by this program. At the end of the log, supply chain-level performance metrics are calculated and printed. These performance measures are computed for each node in the supply chain and include: Inventory carry cost (holding cost) Inventory spend (replenishment cost) Transportation cost Total cost Revenue Profit INFO D1 - 0.0000:D1: Inventory levels:50, on hand:50 INFO D1 - 0.0000:D1:Replenishing inventory from supplier:Supplier1, order placed for 100 units.

Instead of passing dictionaries to utility functions, we instantiate supply chain components as Python objects, providing greater flexibility and extensibility. Each node and link is created as an object, and the simulation is managed within a SimPy environment, allowing for more advanced customization and integration with other SimPy-based processes. import simpy # importing simpy to create a simpy environment env = simpy.Environment() # create a simpy environment # create an infinite supplier supplier1 = scm.Supplier(env=env, ID='S1', name='Supplier', node_type=\"infinite_supplier\") # create a distributor node distributor1 = scm.InventoryNode(env=env, ID='D1', name='Distributor1', node_type='distributor', capacity=150, initial_level=50, inventory_holding_cost=0.2, replenishment_policy=scm.SSReplenishment, policy_param={'s':100, 'S':150}, product_buy_price=100, product_sell_price=105) # create a link for distributor link1 = scm.Link(env=env, ID='L1', source=supplier1, sink=distributor1, cost=5, lead_time=lambda: 2) # create demand at distributor1 demand1 = scm.Demand(env=env, ID='d1', name='Demand1', order_arrival_model=lambda: 1, order_quantity_model=lambda:10, demand_node=distributor1) # we can simulate the supply chain env.run(until=20) This script generates an identical simulation log because the network configuration and demand are deterministic. Final statistics will not be included in the log, as overall supply chain statistics are calculated by the function simulate_sc_net . However, node-level statistics will still be available and can be accessed as mentioned earlier. We can proceed to create and simulate the supply chain network using the same functions, create_sc_net and simulate_sc_net , as demonstrated below. # create a supply chain network supplychainnet = scm.create_sc_net(env=env, nodes=[supplier1, distributor1], links=[link1], demands=[demand1]) # simulate supplychainnet = scm.simulate_sc_net(supplychainnet, sim_time=20, logging=True) Note that an additional parameter, env , is passed to the function create_sc_net to create a supply chain network. This is necessary because the SimPy environment ( env ) is now created by us and the same needs to be used for creating the supply chain network and running the simulations.","title":"SupplyNetPy in 10 Minutes"},{"location":"ten_min/#supplynetpy-in-10-minutes","text":"","title":"SupplyNetPy in 10 Minutes"},{"location":"ten_min/#installation","text":"SupplyNetPy can be installed using pip: pip install supplynetpy","title":"Installation"},{"location":"ten_min/#quick-start-building-a-simple-three-node-supply-chain","text":"Follow these steps to create and simulate a basic supply chain with a supplier and a manufacturer:","title":"Quick Start: Building a Simple Three-Node Supply Chain"},{"location":"ten_min/#import-the-library","text":"import SupplyNetPy.Components as scm The Components module in SupplyNetPy offers essential building blocks for constructing supply chain networks.

The Components module contains four sub-modules: core, inventory, logger, and utilities. The core module is responsible for creating supply chain components. It includes classes such as RawMaterial , Product , Inventory , Node , Link , Supplier , Manufacturer , InventoryNode , and Demand . Any new node created using these classes will be instantiated within a SimPy environment. The Inventory class is responsible for monitoring inventories. By default, the classes in the core module support single-product inventories. The Inventory class extends the SimPy Container class to implement the basic behavior of an inventory, including routines to record inventory level changes.

It models dynamic demand patterns using user-defined functions for order arrival times and order quantities, and manages customer tolerance for waiting in case of product unavailability. The demand node automatically places customer orders at configurable intervals and can handle situations where the requested quantity is not immediately available. Customers can either wait (if tolerance is set) or leave the system unfulfilled. The class supports: Customizable lead time and delivery cost per order, Dynamic order splitting based on the minimum split ratio, Backorder management and real-time inventory check. Parameters: env ( Environment ) \u2013 Simulation environment. ID ( str ) \u2013 Unique identifier for the demand node. name ( str ) \u2013 Name of the demand node. order_arrival_model ( callable ) \u2013 Function that models inter-arrival times between customer orders. order_quantity_model ( callable ) \u2013 Function that models the quantity per customer order. demand_node ( Node ) \u2013 Upstream node from which the demand node sources products. tolerance ( float , default: 0.0 ) \u2013 Maximum time customers are willing to wait if required quantity is unavailable. order_min_split_ratio ( float , default: 1.0 ) \u2013 Minimum allowable fraction of the order that can be delivered in split deliveries. delivery_cost ( callable , default: lambda: 0 ) \u2013 Function that models the delivery cost per order. lead_time ( callable , default: lambda: 0 ) \u2013 Function that models the delivery lead time per order. consume_available ( bool , default: False ) \u2013 If True, the demand node consumes available inventory immediately and leaves. **kwargs \u2013 Additional keyword arguments for Node and GlobalLogger.

Methods: Name Description _process_delivery Handles the delivery process, including lead time and delivery cost updates. wait_for_order Waits for required units based on customer tolerance when immediate fulfillment is not possible. customer Simulates customer order placement and fulfillment behavior. behavior Generates continuous customer demand based on the arrival and quantity models. Behavior The demand node generates customer orders at random intervals and quantities using the specified arrival and quantity models. If the upstream inventory can satisfy the order, delivery is processed immediately. If not, the customer may leave immediately (if tolerance is zero) else, the customer waits for the order to be fulfilled within their tolerance time, possibly accepting partial deliveries if a split ratio is allowed. If the tolerance is exceeded, the unmet demand is recorded as a shortage. Assumptions Customer orders arrive following the provided stochastic arrival model. Order quantities follow the specified stochastic quantity model. Customers may wait for the fulfillment of their orders up to the defined tolerance time. Customers can accept split deliveries based on the minimum split ratio. If customer tolerance is zero, customer returns without waiting for fulfillment. Delivery cost and lead time are sampled dynamically for each order (if specified). The connected upstream node must not be a supplier; it should typically be a retailer or distributor node.

It models dynamic demand patterns using user-defined functions for order arrival times and order quantities, and manages customer tolerance for waiting in case of product unavailability. The demand node automatically places customer orders at configurable intervals and can handle situations where the requested quantity is not immediately available. Customers can either wait (if tolerance is set) or leave the system unfulfilled. The class supports: Customizable lead time and delivery cost per order, Dynamic order splitting based on the minimum split ratio, Backorder management and real-time inventory check.

Methods: Name Description _process_delivery Handles the delivery process, including lead time and delivery cost updates. wait_for_order Waits for required units based on customer tolerance when immediate fulfillment is not possible. customer Simulates customer order placement and fulfillment behavior. behavior Generates continuous customer demand based on the arrival and quantity models. Behavior The demand node generates customer orders at random intervals and quantities using the specified arrival and quantity models. If the upstream inventory can satisfy the order, delivery is processed immediately. If not, the customer may leave immediately (if tolerance is zero) else, the customer waits for the order to be fulfilled within their tolerance time, possibly accepting partial deliveries if a split ratio is allowed. If the tolerance is exceeded, the unmet demand is recorded as a shortage. Assumptions Customer orders arrive following the provided stochastic arrival model. Order quantities follow the specified stochastic quantity model. Customers may wait for the fulfillment of their orders up to the defined tolerance time. Customers can accept split deliveries based on the minimum split ratio. If customer tolerance is zero, customer returns without waiting for fulfillment. Delivery cost and lead time are sampled dynamically for each order (if specified). The connected upstream node must not be a supplier; it should typically be a retailer or distributor node.
